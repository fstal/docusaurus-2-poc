# Documentation site PoC

This repo is a brief example of a [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io) site that can be deployed to Vercel with very little configuration.

### How I Created This Example

To get started with Docusaurus on Vercel, you can use the [Docusaurus CLI](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/installation#scaffold-project-website) to initialize the project:

```shell
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

or initialize it directly on vercel using the Docusaurus 2 templete.
